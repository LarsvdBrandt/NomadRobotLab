    Link:
      description: |
        Instances of Link are used to represent either a single input or single
        output of a Task. Using a separate section for links allows to put
        additional information (e.g. a name) on an input or output.

    Task:
      description: |
        Instances of Task are used to represent an activity that happened during workflow
        execution and that was acting on inputs to produce outputs.

    Workflow:
      description: |
        Instances of Workflow are used to represent a set of Tasks that connect input and
        output data objects to produce a provenance graph for those data.

        Workflows themselves can be tasks. This allows to build nested workflows where some
        of the workflow tasks are workflows themselves.
