# NOMAD Oasis Customization Repository 

## scripts:
Scripts created as proof of concept to handle data access. This script runs as a separate service. It communicates met the NOMAD API, and adds meta data to uploads. This method is not secure, as users can communicate with the API directly and avoid communication with the script overall, this would skip the access check. 
This scrips was created as proof of concept, but is now added to the NOMAD-source code.
